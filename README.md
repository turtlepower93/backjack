# GamePlay

## BettingStage

Player places their bet at the beginning of the game before the hands are dealt.

To bet, click on the chips.

Your total wallet is displayed in the bottom left of the screen.

You can see the current Pot in the middle of the screen.

Once you are done betting, Hit Deal!

## Gameplay

In order to win, your hands value must be higher than the dealer.

You can : Hit or Stay.

Hitting adds an additional card to your hand. Be careful, If you go over 21 you lose!

Staying starts the dealers turn. Once the dealer has finished his turn the game is over!

If you get the same value = Tie

# Next Steps

I intend to add the following features:

Add the ability to Split

Add the ability to insure your hand

If you don't have enough to bet a certain amount, then remove that chip from the table.

Add media queries that will allow the game to be played on all devices

Make it prettier! (better background, change the fonts around, different color chips, animations, sound etc.)
